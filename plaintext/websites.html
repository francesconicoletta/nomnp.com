I prefer simple websites.

I recently came across a few particularly bad websites that were
literally unusable. Cookie popups that force you to accept or deselect
every option one by one, huge bars at the top or bottom of the page,
newsletter popups, monstrously big text constrained in a small centered
column, and so on.

All these horrible things sparked in me the idea of writing about what I
like and don't like, on a "simple" website (or at least one that I
consider simple), focused only on content and without distractions. Thus
nomnp was born.
