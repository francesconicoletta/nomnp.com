Every program attempts to expand until it can show stories. Those
programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.
	Nomnp's Law.

Over the last few years nearly every popular app has added "stories."
I don't usually comment on this type of things because chances are I
don't even use said apps, but I just wanted to say that I don't and
can't recommend you to use Signal as it just reached a turning point
for the worse. Even if moves like this could (and usually can't) bring
new users in the short term, apps like Telegram will always have the
upper hand in convenience precisely because of the non-encrypted chats.
