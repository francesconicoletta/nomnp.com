Instructions to replicate my multiuser brew setup on macOS, since brew doesn't
support multiple accounts on the same Mac very well. This assumes you already
have brew installed.

 1. System Settings -> Users & Groups -> Add Account
 2. Create standard account "brew"
 3. System Settings -> Users & Groups -> Add Account
 4. Select "group" from the drop-down menu and create a group named "brew"
 5. System Settings -> Users & Groups -> Click 'i' on the "brew" group
 6. Add your personal, business, brew users to the "brew" group
 7. sudo chown -R brew:admin /opt/homebrew
 8. sudo dscl . create /Users/brew IsHidden 1
 9. sudo chflags hidden /Users/brew
10. sudo visudo
11. Add "%brew ALL = (brew) NOPASSWD: /opt/homebrew/bin/brew" (without quotes)
    at the end of the file.
12. echo 'brewhelper() { pushd -q /Users/brew;sudo -Hu brew /opt/homebrew/bin/brew $@;popd -q; }' | \
    tee ~/.zshrc | sudo -Hu <business> tee /Users/<business>/.zshrc
13. echo 'alias brew="brewhelper $@"' | \
    tee ~/.zshrc | sudo -Hu <business> tee /Users/<business>/.zshrc
14. echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin' | \
    tee ~/.zshenv | sudo -Hu <business> tee /Users/<business>/.zshenv
15. source ~/.zshrc ~/.zshenv
16. sudo chown <business>:staff /Users/<business>/.zshrc /Users/<business>/.zshenv
17. echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> /Users/brew/.zshrc
    We don't care if brew has write permissions on its .zshrc.
18. Optionally change your personal account's home permissions to remove read
    access to your business and brew user. The function on step 13 is needed to
    make this work if the brew user doesn't have read permissions on the
    current PWD.
